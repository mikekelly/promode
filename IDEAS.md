- Add dependency on dots (https://github.com/joelreymont/dots) - audit, install, update must check that it's installed
- Lookup needs clarifying that it depends on the activity not invovling significant amounts of output (that a subagent should summarise for the main agent)
- Do the subagents know they key principles (tests are the documentation)
- Should the principles be framed as key ideals that it is the responsibility of the agents to help the repo move towards?
